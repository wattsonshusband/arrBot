## arr suite commander

A discord bot that allows you to communicate with any server that contains Sonarr or Radarr.

I made this bot so I can talk to my Radarr and Sonarr server from anywhere since it is via discord's message encryption. 
Now, is it bad maybe. but we all have our ideas.
This code is MID at best, so if you find any memory leaks or stuff then make a branch or raise the issue and I will look into it.

## Dependences
Node.js - kinda obvious.

discord.js
dotenv

## DOT ENV contents
So this script does use dotenv to hold specific variables which shouldn't be accessed normally.

BOT_TOKEN=
PREFIX=r.
OWNER_ID=
BASE_URL=
RADARR_KEY=
SONARR_KEY=
TMDB_API=

Prefix can be moved but I don't want it to be changed from me doing something stupid. so yeah.

Anyway have a good day.
